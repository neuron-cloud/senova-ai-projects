# 🧠 Senova AI Portfolio

## Mission

To develop intelligent systems that elevate human care, cognition, and connection.
Senova AI bridges the gap between logic and empathy, engineering tools that understand nuance, adapt to need, and scale trust.

## Vision

A future where artificial intelligence doesn’t just solve problems, but understands people.
Senova empowers clinicians, creators, and caregivers with precision-guided, emotionally intelligent AI across medicine, mental health, and knowledge work.
We believe the next leap in intelligence isn’t artificial. It’s collaborative.

## Core Values

**1. Human-First Design**

We build for people, not just processes. Every Senova product is shaped around the real emotions, decisions, and challenges of its users.

**2. Precision Meets Empathy**

Our systems combine rigorous data intelligence with emotional awareness, delivering insight that’s not just accurate, but attuned.

**3. Trust Through Transparency**

We believe in clarity, not black boxes. Senova’s tools are built to explain, not obscure.

**4. Innovation With Integrity**

We chase the frontier but stay rooted in ethics, accountability, and long-term human impact.

**5. Adaptable by Design**

From clinical use to cognitive flow, our platforms are modular, interoperable, and built to scale across domains.

**6. Undeniable Excellence**

We aim not just to compete but to set the bar. From code to concept, every Senova product is built to earn trust and withstand scrutiny.

## 🔧 Projects

## Verdict AI
**Human vs. AI Sentence Classifier**

**Tech Stack:** Python · Scikit-learn · Random Forest · NLP Feature Engineering · Entropy Analysis · CSV Parsing · Jupyter/Colab Compatible

**Description:** Verdict AI classifies sentences as either human-written or AI-generated using handcrafted NLP features (lexical diversity, readability, entropy, sentence variance) and a Random Forest model. Designed as a lightweight forensic tool for editorial screening, student work, or content authenticity detection.

**Outcome:** Trained on labeled dataset with 85%+ accuracy with outputs binary classification with explainable features. Open-sourced and ready for experimentation, tuning, or pipeline integration

### Pathway AI
**Autonomous Customer Support Agent for Airlines**

**Tech Stack:** HTML5 · JavaScript · Gemini API (v1.5 / Flash) · Python Tools · Mock Flight/User DB · LLM Tool Chaining · Secure Prompt Architecture

**Description:** Pathway AI is a real-time, LLM-powered customer service agent that autonomously resolves flight support requests—without ever escalating to a human. From verifying bookings and checking flight delays to rebooking passengers and issuing credits, Pathway handles complex multi-step interactions with speed, accuracy, and empathy.

Built as a technical demo for JetBlue/Southwest-style support workflows, the agent uses scripted tools, dynamic prompt logic, and branded UI/UX to simulate a high-fidelity virtual assistant experience.

**Outcome:** Fully functional demo deployed in browser with integrated mock backend. Resolves issues like delays, rebooking, and refund policies using realistic tool functions. Designed for future Gemini API integration, Claude compatibility, and enterprise LLM chaining. Sets the foundation for an intelligent, white-labeled Tier 1/Tier 2 support replacement.

### Triage AI
**Real-Time Medical Triage Engine with Gemini 2.0**

**Tech Stack:** Python · Gemini 2.0 Flash API · JSON-based Clinical Reasoning · Risk Stratification · Batch Processing · RESTful Architecture

**Description:** Triage AI is a lightning-fast clinical risk stratification engine that analyzes free-text clinical inputs—ED presentations, consult notes, EMS handoffs—and returns structured triage decisions in under 2 seconds. Built on Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, it categorizes patients into EMERGENT/URGENT/SEMI_URGENT/ROUTINE levels with confidence scoring, red flag identification, and next-step clinical actions.

**Outcome:** Achieves 85%+ confidence on standard ED presentations. Processes complex clinical narratives in 1-2 seconds. Built for real-world deployment with color-coded urgency display, audit trails, and HIPAA-compliant architecture.

### Synapse 
**Real-Time NLP Risk Flagging Engine for Neurosurgical Consults**

**Tech Stack:** Python · RegEx · NLP · Contextual Negation · Pattern Recognition · GPT-4 Integration · Object-Oriented Design

**Description:**
Synapse is a high-performance clinical NLP engine purpose-built for neurosurgical triage. It parses free-text consult notes to detect high-risk neurological findings in real time—flagging focal motor deficits, altered mental status, reflex abnormalities, sensory levels, and cauda equina features. Leveraging a structured severity model, contextual negation logic, and temporal progression filters, Synapse mimics expert-level triage reasoning with explainable outputs and sub-10ms processing speed.

**Key Features:**

Structured severity classification (🚨 Critical, ⚠️ Warning, ✅ Normal)

Advanced motor parsing with multi-muscle strength mapping

Cauda equina detection engine (saddle anesthesia, retention, rectal tone)

Context-aware negation (e.g., “intact except”, “denies”)

Baseline vs. acute deficit filtering

GPT-powered clinical summaries (optional)

CLI + dashboard interface (v3.0 prototype deployed)

**Outcome:**
Validated across real neurosurgical consults with high sensitivity and minimal false positives. Now powering the clinical intelligence backbone of Senova AI's decision support tools.

### NEURA
**Recovery Forecasting AI for Post-Treatment Clinical Care**

**Tech Stack:** Google Colab · GPT Integration · Prompt Chaining · Python · Clinical Risk Modeling

**Description:** NEURA predicts and supports patient recovery after surgery, hospitalization, or serious illness. From a single clinical note, it generates a structured recovery risk score (Cognitive, Emotional, Functional, Adherence, Social) and delivers emotionally intelligent journaling prompts and recovery guidance for patients.

**Outcome:** Working prototype demo live in Colab. Open-sourced for pilots, partnerships, and feedback.

## 🎯 The Clinical AI Stack

These projects form a full-stack care and intelligence pipeline:

SYSTEM	FUNCTION
1. Verdict AI	Authenticates authorship – Is this human or AI?
   
2. Triage AI	Front door triage – Who needs help now?
   
3. Synapse	Neuro consult parsing – What exactly is wrong?
   
4. NEURA	Post-discharge forecast – How will recovery unfold?
   
5. Pathway AI	Service automation – How do we serve them better?

Together, they represent a vision for AI across the entire care journey—and beyond.

## 💬 Why This

Because AI should augment, not replace.
Because clinical care and customer experience deserve smarter, faster, more humane tools.

I’m building what I wish I had when I was on call:

- NLP that catches hidden red flags

- Triage engines that don’t miss subtle severity

- Support agents that never burn out

- Recovery tools that meet patients where they are

- Classifiers that defend truth in the AI age

---

## 🚀 What's Next

- 🌐 LLM Expansion: Gemini + Claude integrations across stack

- 🏥 Pilot Testing: Triage AI in telehealth, Verdict AI in education/academia

- 🧠 Research: Submitting abstracts on NLP validation and triage impact

- 🧰 Productization: Building a secure, multi-agent backend with RAG + audit trails
